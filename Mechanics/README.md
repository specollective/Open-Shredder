Cycloidal Gearbox
=================

This part was directly derived from https://github.com/RepRapLtd/RobotComponents/blob/main/RRL-cycloidal-drive/
     
The FreeCAD Python macro that generates these gearbox components is in the file Cycloidal-Generator.FCMacro.
First in FreeCAD, go to Macro -> Macro which will open up the window Execute macro
To use it creat a shortcut of Cycloidal-Generator.FCMacro and copy the shortcut to the User Macro Location listed in Execute macro window.



It needs to be refactored into a editible window, also windows short cuts are not the same as sim links, not sure of an easy way to generate them.
